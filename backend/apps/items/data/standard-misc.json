If it hits, the target must immediately roll a D6. If the result is equal to, or lower than his Strength, he rips the net apart. If the result is higher, he may not move, shoot or cast spells in his next turn, although he is not otherwise affected. In either case the net is lost.\n\nNet\n\n\"All one use only items are clearly identified as such. Net is not, so it can be recovered between battles. As indicated in the colour text, it can indeed be torn, cut etc. during battle, but the warrior will simply repair it. I mean swords get bent, shields splintered, armour battered, spear points get blunted during a typical Mordheim battle, and we simply consider the warriors have the basic skills to repair such damage. Same goes for the nets.\""

Known for tying shards of Wyrdstone into the thick strands of his hair and beard and then setting them alight so they set off sparks of unholy fire, he was rightly feared by all Warbands throughout the land and sea.
