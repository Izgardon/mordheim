If anything, their love of revelry has increased with the hardships they have had to endure, as they have learned that life is fleeting, and any excuse to enjoy what they have been given is not to be squandered. One of the products of this love of life and celebration is a strong alcoholic spirit called vodka. It is also one of the country's most famous exports, though most inhabitants of the Old World find it too harsh for their palates. Kislevites take such enjoyment in this drink and regard it as something almost magical. Mothers give vodka to their families to ward off sickness and to keep them warm in the long winter months, and warriors indulge both for luck and courage. Outsiders often scoff at the reputed properties of this liquor, but it must be said that a Kislevite army that is well supplied with vodka certainly fights better and in higher spirits than one without.",

On closer inspection these avatars seem indistinguishable from a normal statue, only springing into life when certain strictures have been violated on the temple grounds. Heavy weathering on the majority of these constructs indicates they may come from an ancient time and that any such magic harnessed during their creation was lost or remains undiscovered. Fanciful tales of hidden shrines, their priests butchered by defilers, now lie concealed in ruin. Ruins watched over by ever vigilant guardians who shall resist all attempts to settle them back into quiet stone, warding off those who dare to unravel the mystery.",
