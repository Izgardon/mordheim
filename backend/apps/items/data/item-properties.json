You uncover several barrels of the finest rums, ales, and other assorted spirits. One is a barrel of Bugman's XXXX, which can be used as per the rules for Bugman's Ale. After 'sampling' many of the other barrels, the remainders are sold off for 2D6x10 gold crowns (after the crew wakes up, of course).\n\n4\tBuried deep in the ruins of an unassuming hovel you find several chests filled with fine clothes, plus several notebooks outlining blackmail information for many of the local trading merchants. You realise this must be one of the stashes left by Facio, the great Tilean trickster and rogue. Armed with your new clothing and information, on your next visit to the trading posts you may buy any one item listed on the regular Price Chart as if it was Common (except any other Pirate Warband unique items, such as Swivel Guns or Treasure Maps), assuming you have the money. Once the transaction is complete, you turn around and sell the notebooks to his competitors for 2D6x10 gold crowns, and make any other trading post purchases as normal.\n\nAlso, if in your next game your warband captures anyone, or finds any Stragglers or Prisoners, the fine clothing impresses them quite a bit! The Captain's Leadership is increased by +1 when testing to see if any join your warband.\n\n5\tThe treasure chest that is found has been carefully booby-trapped! One of your Heroes must try to penetrate the maze of poisoned dart-shooters and collapsing pathways that surround the chest by passing an Initiative test. If he passes, his expert approach reveals a Lucky Charm near the chest (which he claims for himself!), and 3D6x10 gold crowns in the chest itself. If he fails the test, he must sit out the next game as he recovers, but the crew do manage to open the chest now that the traps have been set off and gain the gold as above. They do not find the Lucky Charm though as it is drawn back into it's hiding place, there to await a more careful adventurer.\n\n6\tYour crew bow their heads in reverent silence, as the map has lead them to one of the legendary secret burial spots used by Black-Wyrd the Pirate King, first and finest pirate to ever ravage Mordheim. Known for tying shards of Wyrdstone into the thick strands of his hair and beard and then setting them alight so they set off sparks of unholy fire, he was rightly feared by all Warbands throughout the land and sea.
